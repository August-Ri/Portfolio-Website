          &#x2022;&nbsp;Then we’ll use the same skills we’ve learned to make a banner.<br><br>
          
          &#x2022;&nbsp;After that we’re going to discover ourselves in just one sentence. Making a bio which is interesting to read and attracts people.<br><br>

              In this part of the course we will uncover how each and every tiny detail in our brand impacts our followers.<br><br>
              
              We will make solutions on how to make them like and be attracted to your content.<br><br>
              
              After this section of the course you’ll be ready to make those adjustments yourself, so let’s get started!</p>
      
          </div>

      </div>



      <br><br>

      <!-- Profile Picture -->

      <button class="accordion"><p class="Name" id="Medium">Profile Picture</p><div class="arrow"><img src="arrow.png"></div></button>
      <div class="panel">
  
        <p>Your profile is your <span class="boldo">face</span> on social media.<br><br>

          People will only remember you from the profile picture they see, that’s why it is the most important detail out of them all.<br><br>
          
          If your pfp is looking good - <span class="italico">a high quality, legitimate photo of yourself</span> - people will instantly think of you that way, they’ll be attracted by it.<br><br>
          
          However most of you have a <span class="italico">shitty</span>, trash quality photo of themselves or even just a random stupid picture, which instead of attracting people, makes them loose interest in you instantly.<br><br>
          
          If you hide yourself from others, how to get a trustworthy following then?</p>

          <img src="Images/Psychology/Profile Picture.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

          <p>Almost all of the profile pictures are trash, because nobody knows how to take a good picture of themselves (<span class="italico">we’ll cover how to do it in action section, step by step</span>) and so to stand out is really not that complicated.<br><br>

            Many people implement design over or behind their face, to make it look different, but that’s not the case though.<br><br>
            
            Profile picture often gives emotion. Yes, even that little circle of your face can shine with all of it’s glory and be recognised in an instant if it stands out - <span class="italico">if it is professional/different</span>.<br><br>
            
            And the thing about being authentic is that each of us are special in our own way, the thing we need to do to stand out - <span class="italico">is to show who we really are to others</span>.</p>

            <blockquote class="notion-quote">
              <p class="weak">Your profile picture is your FACE on social media. Make it look so good that people could recognise it in a millisecond!</p>
            </blockquote>
  
      </div>

      <!-- Banner -->

      <button class="accordion"><p class="Name" id="Medium">Banner</p><div class="arrow"><img src="arrow.png"></div></button>
      <div class="panel">
  
        <p>But what about the <span class="boldo">header</span>? or how you call it “<span class="italico">banner</span>”?<br><br>

          Well, it’s just as important as your pfp.<br><br>
          
          It’s the <span class="boldo">background</span> of your profile picture.<br><br>
          
          It’s the back story everything that you’re doing.<br><br>
          
          Yes, It matters a lot too, and you can either make it increase your overall appearance or ruin it.<br><br>
          
          People don’t care as much about it, as your pfp and bio, but it should match the emotion that you’re trying to share.<br><br>
          
          Header is like a big advertisement of your body and personality.<br><br>
          
          People should be attracted by it just like to ads, on social media, who are trying to catch your attention.</p>

          <img src="Images/Psychology/Banner.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

          <p>Mostly headers represent important visual information too.<br><br>

            You can see a lot of people put a little arrow next to the follow button, to guide you to press it, and sometimes it works.<br><br>
            
            Imagine a header like a background behind you, imagine it as the <span class="boldo">landing page</span> (<span class="italico">that’s why I call it header</span>).<br><br>
            
            When people see a well designed banner, they instantly sense the professionalism behind your brand.<br><br>
            
            Make it be worth it.</p>

            <blockquote class="notion-quote">
              <p class="weak">Header/Banner is a background of your profile. It either makes it look more appealing or break everything apart. It’s the last piece in the appearance puzzle. It should be the landing page of your profile.</p>

      </div>

      <!-- Bio -->

      <button class="accordion"><p class="Name" id="Medium">Bio</p><div class="arrow"><img src="arrow.png"></div></button>
      <div class="panel">
  
        <p>Another aspect of your profile is your bio.<br><br>

          Bio literally means biography, and no, not that old boring book about some random guy with all of his actions and memories, it’s about you.<br><br>
          
          When people catch an eye on your profile picture the next thing they will do is check your bio.<br><br>
          
          And if they see a lot of random text, sentences, emojis, symbols, overall just a mess without any structure, they will <span class="boldo">IN AN INSTANT</span> close your profile and never ever come back.<br><br>
          
          That’s how most of you probably share your story with others.<br><br>
          
          No wonder why you look so boring, <span class="italico">even though you are an amazing person in real life</span>.</p>

          <img src="Images/Psychology/Bio.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

          <p>You have to be able to share what you are in a short paragraph, you have to seem <span class="boldo">professional</span> and authentic so that your future clients would have fun reading about you, and for sure, would like to know you more.<br><br>

            While reading it, your brain unconsciously starts to make an imagination of you in real life, they predetermine how you live, act, work, just from reading a couple of lines.<br><br>
            
            By reading a short paragraph we should be able to imagine an exact copy of oneself.<br><br>
            
            When people meet you the first time - <span class="italico">they check your bio</span>.<br><br>
            
            After reading just 2-3 sentences about you, they should know everything.</p>

            <blockquote class="notion-quote">
              <p class="weak">Bio - biography of yourself. Make it enjoyable to read. It forms an imagination of you in your client’s mind. This can either make them like you, or never want to see you again.</p>

            <div class="divider" style="height: 1px; background-color: white; width: 100%;"></div>

            <p>It might get boring at this point to learn about psychology, you can ask yourself “<span class="italico">Why the hell do I have to learn about stupid psychology, why does it matter?</span>”, well it’s the bare bones, the logic behind if you’re going to succeed or not. <br><br>

              I’m telling you this not only to give an understanding on how your mind works, but also to be able to manipulate others with your own skills, which we will cover latter.<br><br>
              
              We have got a <span class="boldo">pfp</span>, <span class="boldo">bio</span>, <span class="boldo">header</span>, what else could there possibly be more to uncover?<br><br>
              
              Well, if you want to make people like you more than anyone they know, you’ve got to invest in your posts, <span class="boldo">graphic</span> <span class="boldo">design</span> and finally a <span class="boldo">website</span>.<br><br>
              
              So let’s continue:</p>
  
      </div>

      <!-- Posts -->

      <div class="panel">
  
        <p>Yes, your writing style matters too.<br><br>

          It can either lead people into reading everything you got to offer, or just make them skim through it and move on without understanding what you’ve meant.<br><br>
          
          The way you write the text - <span class="italico">is your voice</span>.<br><br>
          
          When there is a lot of shit mixed together into one big “<span class="italico">cow’s pancake</span>” (<span class="italico">even bigger shit</span>), no one wants to even read it.<br><br>
          
          Ofcourse, your true followers don’t even care about the structure of how you write, they care about what you’re trying to share, but that’s the minority of people.<br><br>
          
          We all want to read a well spaced, pointed out, clear text, so that it would be easy and beautiful to read.</p>

          <img src="Images/Psychology/Posts.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

          <p>Text is the way to share your emotions.<br><br>

            While reading, a person should be taken into another dimension of your story, that you’re trying to tell, they should be super interested and attracted by it so that they’d do anything you tell them too.<br><br>
            
            Make your unique, authentic self shine throughout the words that you’ve written and everyone won’t have a problem talking back to you too.</p>

            <blockquote class="notion-quote">
              <p class="weak">Text - your voice. Be able to talk clearly so that it would be easy to listen and understand. Share your emotions with words, manipulate people into believing what you’re telling them to.</p>

          Was that luck or you attracted them because of your content?<br><br>
          
          Well, people get attracted way easier if they see a stunning and high quality, custom made graphic design, made specific for that post.<br><br>
          
          It just gets into your consumers brains that you are the one - <span class="italico">you’re that good one</span>, and they want to get back and back to see your posts with amazing art to be entertained.<br><br>
          
          The thing with this is, that you don’t only make your followers get back to you, but also attract way more new eyes than you expected.</p>

          <img src="Images/Psychology/Graphic Design.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

          <p>When you scroll, what you see is text.<br><br>

            You don’t expect to see a stunning design, and when you do, you definitely stop to read it, and give feedback.<br><br>
            
            That’s the magic of being different.<br><br>
            
            Well you got to be thinking now that you “<span class="italico">don’t even know how to do graphic design</span>”, don’t worry, I will teach you latter in this course!</p>

            <blockquote class="notion-quote">
              <p class="weak">Post with graphic design gets way more eyes than regular text, because no one knows how to make design. Be the one who knows how to do it at the end of this course.</p>

      <div class="panel">
  
        <p>The last thing I want to uncover is the psychology behind websites.<br><br>

          To have your own custom website defeats everything I’ve said earlier. <br><br>
          
          When people see that you’ve got a fucking website they get out of their minds.<br><br>
          
          Why do people do that?<br><br>
          
          It’s because no one knows how to make a websites themselves, they do know that they cost a lot to make though.<br><br>
          
          When they do see a person who knows how to do it or has done it, no matter the pfp, bio or header, the person <span class="boldo">instantly</span> believes that you’re professional.<br><br>
          
          If you can do it, you’re “golden”.</p>

          <img src="Images/Psychology/Website Development.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

          <p>Website is where you sell yourself, it’s your evidence of existence.<br><br>

            When people open it, they should be greeted with professionalism and clarity.<br><br>
            
            Yes, the web should be well built too, not like you see, almost everyone uses free softwares to make an “<span class="italico">ok</span>” page.<br><br>
            
            It works, but is not effective at all, that’s why to have a <span class="boldo">professional</span> website is a must.<br><br>
            
            It’s an instant win of being better than all the competition.</p>

        <!-- Theory -->
  
        <button class="accordion"><p class="Name" id="Normal">Theory</p><div class="arrow"><img src="arrow.png"></div></button>
        <div class="panel">

          <p>I’m an enthusiastic, professional photographer with over <span class="boldo">3 years of experience</span> (<span class="italico">see my photos</span> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/augustas_armalis/" class="lita" target="_blank">here</a>).<br><br>

            Doing it all because it’s one of my many passions which I enjoy doing everyday.<br><br>
            
            Don’t worry if you don’t know anything about photography, I’ll make sure to give you a strong foundation of the things you need to do in order to become one!<br><br>
            
            Let’s start from learning:</p>

          <br>
    
          <!-- Composition -->
  
          <button class="accordion"><p class="Name" id="Light">Composition</p><div class="arrow"><img src="arrow.png"></div></button>
          <div class="panel">
    
            <p>It is super important to learn composition in order to take a competent photo, and I’ll tell you everything about it within <span class="boldo">6 pin points</span>.<br><br>

              Now go to your phone or camera settings and enable what’s called “<span class="italico">grid</span>”.<br><br>
              
              It will show 4 intersecting lines on your screen which will help us. <br><br>
              
              Then go outside and lets learn and at the same time practise!<br><br>
              
              <span class="boldo">1. Follow the Rule of Thirds</span><br><br>
              
              The “rule of thirds” is a composition technique that is super easy to learn and just as easy to apply to your images to help you create better photos.<br><br>
              
              When it comes to capturing photos, many people simply point the camera at their subject and press the shutter button.<br><br>
              
              Job done! By following the rule of thirds, however, you can create a stronger, more interesting photo which, undeniably, makes your photo look professional.<br><br>
              
              Now, when you have got your “<span class="italico">grid</span>” enabled, simply compose your shot so your main focal points (<span class="italico">things you want to shoot</span>) are positioned on, or close to, one of the four intersecting lines.<br><br>
              
              If that’s not possible, then position your subject along one of the lines or in the middle of the window.</p>

              <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Grid 1.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

              <p>Any photo that you take, in which the main subject is placed just there, where the lines cross, will make your photo look professional.<br><br>

                Here are a few examples of <span class="boldo">MY</span> photos that follow the <span class="italico">rule of thirds</span> used in photography:</p>

              <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Grid 2.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

              <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Grid 3.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

              <p><span class="boldo">1.1 Breaking the Rule of Thirds</span><br><br>

                There are times, of course, when rules are meant to be broken – <span class="italico">for example, when you want to fill your frame with your subject, which is often the case with portraits, pets, or when you want to photograph a landscape or subject with a lot of symmetry</span>.</p>

              <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Grid 4.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

              <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Grid 5.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

              <p><span class="boldo">2. Include Texture</span><br><br>

                Add interest and detail to your portrait photography by including texture in your images.<br><br>
                
                Position your subject against a background which has a contrasting texture.<br><br>
                
                For example, rough tree, wall, any object which can form a beautiful view just behind you (<span class="italico">don’t worry about it too much, because we’re going to use something called “bokeh” to make it blurred</span>)</p>

              <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Texture.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

              <p><span class="boldo">3. Create a Shallow Depth of Field</span><br><br>

                You probably have seen that “<span class="italico">professional</span>” looking background blur, it’s called “<span class="italico">bokeh</span>” and unfortunately it’s achieved only on a camera, because it has a setting called aperture, which determines how much light goes into the camera.<br><br>
                
                The more light, the bigger “<span class="italico">bokeh</span>” blur behind you.</p>

              <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Aperture.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

              <p>This is the thing that mobile phones cannot naturally do, only with a help with <span class="italico">AI</span> you can make it on your smartphone, but it doesn’t seem real.<br><br>

                By seeing the blur behind you, everyone will instantly associate the taken photo with <span class="boldo">professionalism</span>, because bokeh makes the image <span class="boldo">POP</span>!</p>

              <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Bokeh.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

              <p><span class="boldo">4. Provide Direction</span><br><br>

                When positioning your subject A.K.A. - <span class="italico">yourself, consider the direction of your body and eyes</span>.<br><br>
                
                Compose your photo so you have space to look at to, not directly to the camera - <span class="italico">don’t be a creep</span>.<br><br>
                
                You might say to me now that you don’t know how to pose?<br><br>
                
                I’ll tell you a secret - <span class="italico">the way that you’re reading this right now is your natural form</span> (<span class="italico">fix your back to be straight</span>).<br><br>
                
                Try to be yourself and don’t overthink it.<br><br>
                
                Just stand, legs shoulder width and improvise, be yourself!</p>

                <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Direction.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

                <p><span class="boldo">5. Use Leading Lines</span><br><br>

                  This minor detail can truly enhance your photo.<br><br>
                  
                  By finding lines which lead the way of the frame, like a road or pillars like in example, and when you frame your camera, look that the place where it ends in the horizon is in the middle of the frame (<span class="italico">or try to put yourself just at the point where it ends/leads</span>).<br><br>
                  
                  The point is, that this makes the whole world around you, lead towards you and so makes your photo look well placed.</p>
                
                  <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Leading Lines.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">

                  <p><span class="boldo">6. Break the rules</span><br><br>

                    Considering all of what I’ve said to you, break all the rules you can.<br><br>
                    
                    It’s you, who is controlling everything, so be creative and find your way into positioning the camera - <span class="italico">the way that think is the best for you</span>.<br><br>
                    
                    Shoot for the moon.</p>

                    <img src="Images/Action/Profile Picture/Moon.png" width="100%" height="auto" style="margin-top: 10px; border-radius: 0.2em;" id="photo">
